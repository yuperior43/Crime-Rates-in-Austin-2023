I am interested in investigating the crime rates in Travis County over the past few years and the attributes of each crime. In particular, I will look at the prevalence of various types of crimes, such as domestic violence and indecent exposure, and I will visualize the volume of crimes occurring each year. My goal is to assess the trends in crime prevalence and the types of crime that occur most often.

This analysis is important to me because crime affects millions every year, so it must be analyzed to create effective prevention and control policies. Austin is notoriously crime-ridden, having the 15th biggest homicide rate, problem, per Fox: https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-named-city-with-15th-biggest-homicide-rate-problem-study. Property crimes are also high, and it is not uncommon for one's personal belongings to be stolen. With such a pronounced presence of crime, measures must be taken with great precedence.

The dataset I will use is a public database of reported crimes from 2003 to the present day.

The database can be found here: https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu.

I will compare crime rates between each year and see if there are general trends in types of crimes as well as overall crime occurrence.

*Note: This analysis will touch on subjects like sexual assault, murder, and child abuse. These topics may be disturbing or upsetting to some, so please take caution!*
